## The logo of coronet

We provide different variants of the logo of `coronet` here in the [`logo`](https://github.com/se-sic/coronet/blob/master/logo) directory (with/without font, with/without background color, inverted variants to be used on dark-themed pages, etc.). For each of these variants, we provide the logo in `png` format as well as in `svg` format. In addition, there are `combined` `svg` files (with/without font) from which all the other variants have been created.

**Note:** To use the `svg` files that contain the font, the used font type has to be installed on your system (otherwise the font will be displayed wrongly). For the logo of `coronet`, we use the *Larabie Font*, which can be downloaded here: [https://www.dafont.com/de/larabie-font.font](https://www.dafont.com/de/larabie-font.font).
(If you use a Debian system, you can also install the following Debian package instead: [https://packages.debian.org/sid/fonts/fonts-larabie-deco](https://packages.debian.org/sid/fonts/fonts-larabie-deco))
